        <p>The <em>dog</em> is awesome because <strong>it is extremely intelligent creature with a loyalty to its humans</strong>. It is a subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and is related to foxes, coyotes, and jackals. The scientific name of the dog is Canis lupus familiaris. A dog can fit easily into family life. It thrives on praise and affection. When a person tells a dog that it is good, the animal happily wags its tail. But when a person scolds a dog, it skulks away with its tail tucked between its legs. Dogs exist in a wide range of sizes, colors, and temperaments. Some, such as the Doberman pinscher and the German shepherd, can serve as alert and aggressive watchdogs. Others, such as the beagle and the cocker spaniel, can be playful family pets, even though they were bred for hunting. Still others, such as the collie and the Welsh corgi, can herd farm or range animals. Each of the dogs just mentioned is a purebred.</p>
