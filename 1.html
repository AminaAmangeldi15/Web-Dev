    <h1>To the New Year</h1>
    <p>
        With what stillness at last <br>
you appear in the valley <br>
your first sunlight reaching down <br>
to touch the tips of a few <br>
high leaves that do not stir <br>
as though they had not noticed <br>
and did not know you at all <br>
then the voice of a dove calls <br>
from far away in itself <br>
to the hush of the morning <br>
<br>
so this is the sound of you <br>
here and now whether or not <br>
anyone hears it this is <br>
where we have come with our age <br>
our knowledge such as it is <br>
and our hopes such as they are <br>
invisible before us <br>
untouched and still possible <br>
